Each conversational UI, example ``Chat window`` has their specific files which comprise of at least:

1. An index file in ``html`` extension,

#### How to use the conversational User Interfaces

To use any conversational UI of your choice, just download the zip file, say ``chat-window.zip``, extract the files, and edit as desired. Then you may need to embbed the UI, say ``Chat window`` in your existing project or host the files entirely as a new project as in ``Conversational portfolio`` which does not support being embedded into an existing project.
