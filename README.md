                 <img src="img/icon/helene.png" alt="Helene icon" />

### Helene UIs (User Interfaces) are minimal conversational user interfaces

#### Features of `Helene UIs` include:

1. `Highly responsive`; beautiful across all devices,
2. `Easily integrable` into any existing project,
3. `Customizable` to your desired design.

#### Available conversational User Interfaces

1. `Conversational portfolio`
2. `Chat window`
3. `Embeddable chat UI`
4. `Overlay chat UI`
5. More

#### Files in each User Interface

Each conversational UI, example `Chat window` has their specific files which comprise of at least:

1. An index file in `html` extension,
2. Specific stylesheets in `css` folder,
3. Themes file to choose from in `css` folder,
4. Specific fonts in `fonts` folder,
5. Scripts in `js` folder,
6. More files specific to the respective UI.

#### How to use the conversational User Interfaces

To use any conversational UI of your choice, just download the compressed file, say `chat-window.rar`, extract the files, and edit as desired. Then you may need to embbed the UI, say `Chat window` in your existing project or host the files entirely as a new project as in `Conversational portfolio` which does not support being embedded into an existing project.
